Rather than create a seperate repositiory for each version of 1.46 I've opted to create a directory of all the files wich are different from BMR_Insurgency_v1_46.Altis
Each of these folders are the mission names for each version of 1.46.
The following instructions are an example of how to build Lingor version.

1. Donwload all files from Altis version.
	https://github.com/Jigsor/BMR_Insurgency.Altis

2. Download Lingor files
	https://github.com/Jigsor/BMR-Insurgency/tree/master/BMR_Insurgency_v1_46%20Variations/BMR_Insurgency_v1_46.lingor3

3. Replace Altis versioned files with Lingor versioned files.
	Do not replace the existing directories in Altis version only the files contained in the directories.
	These directories in Altis version contain other existing vital files. Do not delete them.

4. Rename the Altis version root folder
	BMR_Insurgency_v1_46.Altis
	to
	BMR_Insurgency_v1_46.lingor3
	or something else of your choosing and your finished.


//Not all v1.46 variants have yet been updated to v1.47, but note that all v1.47 code base is backwards compatible with v1.46 mission.sqm files
